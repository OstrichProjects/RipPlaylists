Rip Youtube Videos from a Playlist
==================================

Uses Google's Youtube API and the Python library YAFY to find and download the audio from Youtube videos based on a playlist.

Using Spotify:  The easiest way to copy and paste a playlist from Spotify into a txt file is, while in the playlist on Spotify, to hit Ctrl+A to select all of the songs.  Hit Ctrl+C to copy them.  Visit the [Spotify community website](https://community.spotify.com/) and go to any page where you can send a message or post a reply (I usually click on messages, and reply to the Spotify greeting message, but anything works as long as you stay on the Spotify website).

Dependencies:
-------------

    (sudo) pip install -r requirements.txt
